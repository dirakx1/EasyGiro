# Iotacore for easygiro


* IOtacore will be in charge of controlling the money transfer transactions. 

* As example we can interac with MAINET, using a python or go library 
(this is before we have our own node, that would be terraformed) for this purpose 
we use: https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.py


## Requirements to test the interactions with IOTA

* pip install pyota
* pip install pyota[ccurl]
