# Iotacore for easygiro


* Iotacore will be in charge of controlling money transactions. 

* As example we can interact with DEVNET and MAINET, using a python or go library 
(this is before we have our own node, that would be terraformed) for this purpose 
we use: https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.py or 
https://docs.iota.org/docs/iota-go/0.1/README

## Hello world
* See iota.lib/examples/helloworld

## Tests


## Requirements 

To test the interactions with IOTA using Pyota you have to install
the folowing dependencies. 

* pip install pyota
* pip install pyota[ccurl]

But you can also use the go client library.
