Money transactions can be represented as data transfer into the tangle,
the real world use of the data depends on the interaction api. 

## IOTA ledger

* IOTA ledger makes possible to do real time transactions, 
in our case money transfers!. (these transactions are "feeless" and can be "microtransactions") 
* IOTA ledger use and specifics are docummented in [iotacore](/iotacore/README.md)

## Interaction API

The interaction api is in charge of making calculations to change hard currency to 
iota and viceverza, also it makes posible communication with banks services.  

* The interaction api specifics are documented on [apicore](https://github.com/jcortes/easygiro-server)

### Infrastructure considerations 

* Microservice oriented arquitecture on k8s (GCP or AWS or others).
* The microservices can convert IOTA -to- fiat or fiat -to- IOTA 
and connect to banks APIs


## Clients
* Clients can be any IOT devices (smartphones, smartwatch, laptops..) 
* Also, it can be used to pick in place transfers

## Use cases. 
* International transfers
* Local transfers 
* Local tranfers in hard currencies
