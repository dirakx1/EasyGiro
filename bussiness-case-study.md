* For starters Easygiro can be coupled to work without any specifical backend if you have a cripto wallet. 


## Proposed finantial Workflow

<img src="./finantial-workflow.png">

* 1. Cellphone/Laptop. Easygiro UI (in top of transfiya/PSE/Payzen and/or IOTA)  
* 2. Easygiro/Transfiya(PSE)/Payzen should give us the amount to transfer. 
* 3. Transfer that amount to Our IOTA - blockchain wallet.
* 3. (A) Also another posibility could be transfering to a normal bank account and then this could be claim at a physical point. (Efecty / servientrega. Know the regulations. Show them the solution . with demo.) for this case we have to make 
a web service that tells us the amount of money transfered to the local bank account. 
* 4. Going back to transfiya/Payzen - Easygiro. if needed. if not transfer to blackchain wallet.

### Competitors / allies
* powwi 

* How much could  a transaction cost ? 

* Our main focus could be micro payments or micro transfers.
* Also for people that dont have bank accounts.

## Advantages of a DLT. 
* Knowing the state of the transaction in any given time.
* Easy interactions with digital currencies.
* Not having to rely on a centralized solution (pse/payzen/credibanco...)
